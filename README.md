This is a collection of scripts I wrote for the following purposes.

## PitchDataImport.R
[PitchDataImport.R](https://github.com/evvillalpando/SwingandMissRates2018MLB/blob/master/PitchDataImport.R) is a script containing all the functions I created to import the dataâ€”that's it.

## DataVisBaseball2018.R
Script used to experiment with ggplot and ggimage packages, and ultimately visualize the swing and miss rates by team for the 2018 season
